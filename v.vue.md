**all Vue components are also Vue instances**

- properties in data are only reactive if they existed when the instance was created.
- Vue instances expose a number of useful instance properties and methods. These are prefixed with $ to differentiate them from user-defined properties. For example:
- Donâ€™t use arrow functions on an options property or callback Since arrow functions are bound to the parent context,

# basic
- el 
- data
- methods
